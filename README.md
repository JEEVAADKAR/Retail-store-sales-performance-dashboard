The Retail Store Sales Performance Dashboard is a data analytics project developed using SQL, Excel, and Power BI. The main objective of this project is to analyze the sales data of a retail store and gain meaningful business insights. The dataset was first cleaned and processed using SQL queries and Excel functions, ensuring accuracy and consistency before importing it into Power BI. In Power BI, interactive visualizations were created to display key metrics such as total sales, profit, quantity sold, top products, top customers, and monthly sales trends. The dashboard allows users to filter data by product category, region, and customer, helping decision-makers easily identify top-performing areas and underperforming segments. Overall, this project provides a clear and comprehensive view of the store’s sales performance, helping management make data-driven decisions to improve sales strategies and business growth.
